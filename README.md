# Mugshot

Mugshot.py is a simulation of an automated facial recognition system using the dlib face recognition model. The facial encoding library was created with publicly accessible mugshot imagery and the charges associated with each image. The user submits an image that contains one or multiple faces. Mugshot.py will then return the closest match, the accuracy percentage and the charges associated with the match.
