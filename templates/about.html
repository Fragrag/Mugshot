      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Facial recognition systems are starting to become commonplace in our modern day society. Many major cities have
        implemented such systems in their CCTV systems and are being ostensibly used to combat crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        The accuracy of these systems have been questioned. Trials in London resulted in a 96% rate of false positives,
        where the software incorrectly matches a person with a photo on the database.[1] The city of San Francisco has
        banned the use of facial recognition technology by departments under its jurisdiction due to concerns on privacy
        and ethics.[2]
      </p>

      <p>
        Mugshot.py simulates such a facial recognition system. Its facial encoding library was created with publicly
        accessible mugshot imagery and the charges associated with each image. The user submits an image that contains
        one or multiple faces. Mugshot.py will then return the closest match, the accuracy percentage and the charges
        associated with the match.
      </p>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Mugshot imagery is first collected from JailBase, a service that provides pubicly available arrest information from US states where publication of such data is legal. When the collection process is run, images are collected from the 10 most recent entries from each US county. The entry is anonymised and finding the original JailBase entry is rendered impossible to be found, by the user of this nor by the creator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each mugshot image is analyzed. When an image is not valid or a face was not found, it is not inserted into the dataset. Likewise if no charges are presented, it is not included as well. If valid, the face's location in the image, unique encoding and associated charges are inserted into the dataset. 
      </p>

      <p>
        When a user submits an image, the image undergoes a similar process. The nearest match in the dataset for each face found in the submitted inage. The user then can see the submitted image with the encoding visualised, the accuracy percentage to the nearest match and its associated charges. The accuracy percentage is calculated using <a class="link" href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/wiki/Calculating-Accuracy-as-a-Percentage">this method</a> with the default threshold of 0.6.
      </p>

      <h2>Credits</h2>
      <p>
        Mugshot.py was created by <a class="link" href="http://www.haryosukmawanto.com/">Haryo Sukmawanto</a>, a
        multimedia artist based in Ghent, Belgium. It owes particular thanks to Adam Geitgey for his library <a
          class="link" href="https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition">face_recognition</a>. The facial encoding
        data was created using resources from <a class="link" href="https://www.jailbase.com/">JailBase</a>. Data
        acquired from Jailbase has been anonymised and its contents are not traceable to the origin.
